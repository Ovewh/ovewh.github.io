The virtual EGU 2021 general assembly was my first time attending a science conference. I presented the research 
I have done during my Master thesis on modelling of transport and deposition of aeolian dust 
over the Chinese Loess Plateau and in particular I have been examining the linkage between the 
East Asian Winter Monsoon and deposition over Chinese Loess Plateau. If you would like
to know more I made a recording where I go into more details (scroll down to the bottom).

I had big expectations going into to the conference and put a lot of effort into making a nice slide and 
rehearsing my 2 minutes vPICO presentation. 
As any first time attendee I was nervous during moments leading up to the 2 minutes time slot allocated for me. 
Then it was my turn, I unmuted myself (at least I didn't forget that :sweat_smile: ) and began on the talk I had rehearsed 
so many times during the day before. The two minutes flew past and I felt pretty good about my performance during the 
talk. With my presentation finished I could focus on the remaining presentation until the discussion the breakout rooms 
started.

The last speaker finished and the convener opened the breakout rooms, I jumped into my own room and waited, 10 minutes 
pasted no-one joined,
then 10 more minutes passed I was still sitting there alone. I was starting to lose fait that anyone would join my breakout 
room, so joined the zoom call from my laptop so I at least I could visit the other 
authors breakout rooms. With 15 minutes left of the breakout session one person joined my session! We discussed for 
the remainder of the time the breakout room was open. I was really happy :smile: that I at least got to some of what a 
conference is about. 

## What I learned from attending and preparing for a conference
1. **Getting to the meat of my research.** When you have only 2 minutes to present something you have spent almost two 
years working on, you really have to get to meat of your research and find the juicy bits. 
For me this was a really necessary exercise as up to this point I had been
mostly concerned with running model simulations and doing data analysis. After going through this process I now feel 
that I have a storyline that I can use as a basis for writing my thesis.
1. **Research is so diverse.** The wast number of different topics present at EGU surprised me. I visited many 
different sessions, listen to the debates and learned new things during the short courses. Even though I was a 
bit shy and unsure at beginning I felt more confident towards the end. I know more now about what to expect and hope that 
next time I can attend in person.
3. **I'm not that stupid (and it is okay to be stupid).** When you are surrounded by so many clever scientists it is easy 
to feel inferior and stupid. At least you don't want other people to get the impression that your are 
so. But after visiting the different authors in the breakout chats I realized that it is fine if my question might at 
first sound stupid, and that the authors are nice about it and eager to explain. Even people way more 
experienced than me had some of the same basic questions as me. Actually I realized that a good way of overcoming the 
"Imposter syndrome " is engage and interact with other scientist.

Getting to know people was more difficult during the virtual conference. When I get the chance go to a conference I person 
I'll know to take advantage of the networking possibilities that a 
conference offers. 

Thanks EGU for a nice virtual conference and I hope to get the chance to take part in Vienna some
time in future!
